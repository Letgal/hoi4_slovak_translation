 SOV_revive_the_stakhanovite_movement_desc:0 "Cruel exploitation drives the worker in capitalist countries to push themselves harder and produce more for those who own the factories. In our country, workers like Alexey Stakhanov drive themselves further because they know that every extra brick laid, every extra ton of coal mined, every extra rivet put in place helps build a world in which the workers are free from exploitation forever."
 SOV_war_heroes:0 "War Heroes"
 SOV_war_heroes_desc:0 "Russians have always been able and willing to perform deeds of extreme bravery in the cause of defeating any invader of the motherland. While we are united in our struggle against the enemy, we should not pretend that there aren't some soldiers in our military who have gone far beyond the call of duty."
 SOV_collectivist_propaganda:0 "Collectivist Propaganda"
 SOV_collectivist_propaganda_desc:1 "The many challenges facing us never face any citizen alone. All our struggles are shared struggles, consequently, all our achievements are shared achievements."
 SOV_socialist_emulation:0 "Socialist Emulation"
 SOV_socialist_emulation_desc:0 "Under the capitalist system, workers must compete with one another in order to win their daily bread, while the factory owners profit from any improvements the workers make that leads to increased productivity. This is wasteful and inhumane. A socialist system will allow those who are not yet the best the support they need to develop their abilities by learning from those who excell."
 SOV_socialist_realism:0 "Socialist Realism"
 SOV_socialist_realism_desc:1 "The road towards a bright Socialist future is long and often windy. Some people might even lose hope in that this goal can ever be achieved. We must show them exactly what they are working towards, by promoting an art style that shows what life in a socialist country would actually be like."
 SOV_the_komsomol:0 "The Komsomol"
 SOV_the_komsomol_desc:0 "We are not building Socialism for the adults of today, we are building it for the children and the generations not yet born. They must be taught how to improve and build on the achievements we will make, so that they can complete the work that we have started. We should form a special youth organisation that not only educates them but that also teaches them how to be good, communist members of society."
 SOV_patriarch_of_all_russia:0 "Patriarch of All Russia"
 SOV_patriarch_of_all_russia_desc:0 "While there is little reason for backwards superstition in an enlightened, Communist society, we must also acknowledge that many people have found strength and comfort in their faith during difficult times. Building a new kind of society is not short on difficulties, and so perhaps we should allow these religious institutions to continue to function, so long as they remain loyal to the state."
 SOV_the_comintern:0 "The Comintern"
 SOV_the_comintern_desc:0 "The struggle for the worker's liberation is not limited to any country; it is a global struggle. We must extend aid to comrades in any of the nations of the world, and fight the forces of reaction and counter-revolution wherever they may be found."
 SOV_development_aid_for_eastern_allies:0 "Development Aid For Eastern Allies"
 SOV_development_aid_for_eastern_allies_desc:0 "For centuries, western Imperialism and Colonialism have brutally exploited the countries in Asia. A modest investment from us would enable our allies in Asia to resist further capitalist encroachment that much more effectively."

 SOV_war_measures_in_the_east_desc:0 "The global struggle against fascism and other counter-revolutionary ideologies will certainly reach Asia before too long. We must make it clear to our allies that in desperate times, desperate measures might be needed."
 SOV_fortify_mongolian_border:0 "Fortify Mongolian Border"
 SOV_fortify_mongolian_border_desc:0 "While the Japanese hardliners have their eyes on China at the moment, we can not rule out that they might wish to expand their gains by attacking us. We should ensure that our Mongolian Allies don't turn into an open flank."
 SOV_send_military_advisors_to_spain:0 "Send Military Advisors To Spain"
 SOV_send_military_advisors_to_spain_desc:0 "Our comrades in Spain, after winning a democratic election, now face a reactionary counter-revolution. We must support them lest their defeat encourages fascists in other countries."
 SOV_policy_of_collective_security:0 "Policy of Collective Security"
 SOV_policy_of_collective_security_desc:0 "While they are capitalist and often reactionary, the democratic governments across Europe know that the fascists consider them weak and degenerate. If war comes, they would be the first to fall before the full fury of fascism is turned against the home of the revolution. Those politicians far-sighted enough to recognize this should know that they will find a sympathetic ear in Moscow."
 SOV_anti_fascist_policies:0 "Anti-Fascist Policies"
 SOV_anti_fascist_policies_desc:0 "There can be no peaceful co-existence with the fascists. We should reach out to any allies we can find and prepare for the inevitable confrontation."

 SOV_seek_a_defense_pact_with_the_allies_desc:0 "While there have been informal contacts with the western democracies, little concrete and legally binding has been agreed upon. It is time to put ink on paper and declare to the world that the western democracies are willing to form a Combined Front with us against fascist expansion."
 SOV_the_khakimov_proposal:0 "The Khakimov Proposal"
 SOV_the_khakimov_proposal_desc:0 "Comrade Khakimov has worked tirelessly to improve our standing with the government of [SAU.GetNameDef]. Some experts speculate that the region is home to a great amount of natural resources, which the capitalists are no doubt eager to exploit. We should continue to build a relationship of mutual trust in order to keep [SAU.GetNameDef] out of any hostile bloc and allow us first rights on any resources discovered."
 SOV_eradicate_western_fascism:0 "Eradicate Western Fascism"
 SOV_eradicate_western_fascism_desc:0 "We can not wait until the fascist regimes in western Europe deign to attack us at the moment of their choosing. The best way to deal with fascists is to hit first, and to hit hard."
 SOV_policy_of_individual_security:0 "Policy of Individual Security"
 SOV_policy_of_individual_security_desc:0 "We have few friends in the world, and a lot of enemies. We should not be overly concerned with who we make deals with - either they or us will break those deals anyway, once they have served their purpose."
 SOV_approach_germany:0 "Approach Germany"
 SOV_approach_germany_desc:0 "There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to come to accomodation with Germany. We won't be able to peacefully coexist with them forever, of course, but the Germans won't attack us while the western Allies still exist in their back - and we should encourage the Germans to deal with them first."
 SOV_liberation_of_the_european_proletariat:0 "Liberation of the European Proletariat"
 SOV_liberation_of_the_european_proletariat_desc:0 "The spineless bourgeois governments in western Europe have shown utterly unwilling to stand up to fascism. In the great struggle between fascism and communism that is to come, they won't play a role. The workers in those countries, however, are willing to fight with us against the scourge of fascism. We just have to give them governments that are willing to fight."
 SOV_anti_capitalist_policies:0 "Anti-Capitalist Policies"
 SOV_anti_capitalist_policies_desc:0 "It is evident that most, if not all, capitalist countries are perfectly content with merely pointing the fascists in another direction when they plan their expansion. When given the choice, the Bourgeois will always, ultimately, choose to oppress the proletariat. As such we can not trust them and we need to be prepared to take the fight to them."
 SOV_recover_alaska:0 "Recover Alaska"
 SOV_recover_alaska_desc:0 "The sale of Alaska to the Americans was a betrayal of the Russian people by their leadership. It is well past time that this betrayal is reversed, and the land recovered. The population would be much happier as part of our union than being part of the exploitative system that they currently live under."
 SOV_the_fight_for_the_pacific:0 "The Fight For the Pacific"
 SOV_the_fight_for_the_pacific_desc:0 "No matter our strength on land, we will have to cross water to get to grips with our enemies in the Pacific region. We must therefore develop our coastal infrastructure and ship-building industry before we can wage effective war in that area of the world."
 SOV_baltic_security:0 "Baltic Security"

 SOV_respect_baltic_self_determination:0 "Respect Baltic Self-Determination"
 SOV_respect_baltic_self_determination_desc:0 "Every people should be allowed to decide their own affairs in a democratic way. Of course, in many of the bourgeois democracies in the west, this process is immediately perverted by large amounts of money. We will ensure that the workers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have fair representation in their governments."
 SOV_claims_in_baltic:0 "Claims in Baltic"
 SOV_claims_in_baltic_desc:0 "The Baltic States were once an indivisible part of Russia. Their people need the protection of a large state that can defend them from exploitation. If the Baltic States don't agree to these terms, we might have to resort to force to ensure our protection."
 SOV_secure_leningrad:0 "Secure [195.GetName]"
 SOV_secure_leningrad_desc:1 "Our current border with Finland is far too close to [195.GetName] for comfort. A surprise attack from Finland could reach the city in a few hours. The location also makes it very easy to blockade our Baltic Fleet. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, and we must make this clear to the Finnish government."
 SOV_control_scandinavia:0 "Control Scandinavia"
 SOV_control_scandinavia_desc:0 "The last remaining threat to our northern border are the governments on the Scandinavian peninsula. We must impress on them the fact that peaceful coexistence requires mutual trust, and we can not trust a government whose ideology does not align with ours."
 SOV_claims_on_poland:0 "Claims on Poland"
 SOV_claims_on_poland_desc:1 "Poland holds territories that have been Russian for centuries, splitting Ukraine and Belarus between our nations. This is an unacceptable state of affairs. They may have bested us in 1921, but we should remind them that times have changed."
 SOV_demand_eastern_poland:0 "Demand Eastern Poland"
 SOV_demand_eastern_poland_desc:1 "At the end of the great war, the Curzon line was established and agreed upon as Poland's eastern border. That line runs some 200 kilometers west of Polands current border. We should remind them of this basic historical fact and ensure that the border is where it should be."
 SOV_offer_poland_protection:0 "Offer Poland Protection"
 SOV_offer_poland_protection_desc:1 "Poland and the Polish people have suffered many deprivations and humiliations over the centuries. It is an open secret that the Germans want the territories given to Poland after the Great War back, and are willing to use violence to get them. We should offer the Polish government our protection, so long as they are willing to discuss the issue of our shared border."
 SOV_claim_on_bessarabia:0 "Claim on Bessarabia"
 SOV_claim_on_bessarabia_desc:0 "In 1918, the Romanians shamelessly capitalized on our internal troubles and annexed Bessarabia. It is time to remind them that they hold land that legally belongs to us, and if they are unwilling to restore the correct borders, we will force them out through military means."
 SOV_demand_balkan_submission:0 "Demand Balkan Submission"
 SOV_demand_balkan_submission_desc:0 "Past experiences have shown that the countries around us will exploit any weakness that we show. With war brewing in Europe, we can ill afford to have neighbours with questionable allegiences. The countries in the Balkans and in Asia minor will have to choose whether they want to stand with us or against us."
 SOV_seek_balkan_cooperation:0 "Seek Balkan Cooperation"
 SOV_seek_balkan_cooperation_desc:0 "The countries of Balkan peninsula and in Asia minor can make powerful allies, if we can get them to align their ideological views more closely with our own."

 SOV_support_afghan_ideology:0 "Support Afghan [GetIdeologyNameWithCaps]"
 SOV_support_afghan_ideology_desc:0 "Afghanistan is where proud nations are humbled. A military operation in the country would be costly at best and might not even succeed. We have a few contacts in Afghanistan who wish to establish a government that is ideologically closer aligned to us. We should support this endeavour."
 SOV_preemptive_invasion_of_iran:0 "Preemptive Invasion of Iran"
 SOV_preemptive_invasion_of_iran_desc:0 "The government of [PER.GetNameDef] can not be trusted to support us should war come, nor can we fully trust them not to enter a war against us. Rather than wait and see, we should force the issue and clear up the situation."
 SOV_the_threat_from_the_land_of_the_rising_sun:0 "The Threat from the Land of the Rising Sun"
 SOV_the_threat_from_the_land_of_the_rising_sun_desc:0 "It is clear that Japan wishes to dominate China. Once they have accomplished this, they will no doubt turn north to take the vast resources in Siberia. As long as they are busy in China, they will prefer not to move against us, and so we should ensure that the war in China last until we are ready to contest the Japanese."
 SOV_the_gobi_gambit:0 "The Gobi Gambit"
 SOV_the_gobi_gambit_desc:0 "While the conflict between Japan and China is heating up, there is an opportunity for us to seize the area around the Gobi desert, to give us a say in the future of China and a seat at the table."
 SOV_two_red_flags:0 "Two Red Flags"
 SOV_two_red_flags_desc:0 "While the revolution has not quite succeeded in China, this is not unexpected.

Still, the communist party represents the best chance for the Chinese people to achieve a communist future."
 SOV_support_the_kuomintang:0 "Support the Kuomintang"
 SOV_support_the_kuomintang_desc:0 "The Chinese communists are militarily weak and have no industrial base from which to build a bigger army.
